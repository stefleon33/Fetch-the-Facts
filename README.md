## Overview

Pre-work Project for Code the Dream. Basic JavaScript app with a call to the https://thedogapi.com. The app has information and pictures about dog breeds.

This project was to build a site using one one of the provided public APIs.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

Access two different sets of data about dogs from the API
Navigate to specific pages containing this data and navigate back to the home page.

## My process

I coded this project with a mobile first approach. This project uses css, html, and javascript to provide a website with 3 separate pages. The home page provides general information while the breed stats and history pages show the corresponding api data.

## Built with

-JavaScript
-HTML
-CSS
-Flexbox
-BootStrap

## What I learned

This project increased my confidence in calling apis and then displaying them on a webpage using a list format. It also refreshed my memory in creating and linking multiple pages within a home page.

## Continued development

In the future, I would like to utilize api data and incorporate it into my project in new ways, increasing my knowledge and confidence in the areas of apis and javascript.
