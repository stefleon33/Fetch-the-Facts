## Overview

This is the advanced pre-work assignment for Code the Dream that allows me to demonstrate a general knowledge of APIs. It is a basic JavaScript app with calls to the [TheDogAPI](https://thedogapi.com).

### Project Requirements:

- Display the data for at least 2 of the end-points in the API
- Include navigation from each end-point’s page to the other end-points that are displayed

## Features

📚 Breed History Page – Learn how each breed came to be, what they were originally bred for, and how they’ve evolved.

📊 Breed Stats Page – View important traits like size, life span, and temperament.

🐶 Clean Design – Simple layout and responsive design for easy browsing on any device.

💡 No frameworks required – Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## My process

The first part of my process was to plan and research. I read through the materials provided be Code the Dream to understand the depth of the project and the requirements. I also went to the 7 different APIs given as options to see what they offered. I ultimately choose to use [TheDogAPI](https://thedogapi.com) because it's content is different from previous projects I have worked on and technically speaking, it has easy to use endpoints with many pieces of data to pull.

The second part of my process was to build and test. This project was built using JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML to create three pages with cards on two of the pages. I I coded this project with a mobile first approach. This project uses css, html, and javascript to provide a website with 3 separate pages. The home page provides general information while the breed stats and history pages show the corresponding api data.

## Built with

- JavaScript
- HTML

```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```

3. Open index.html in your browser:

- Double-click file

  _or_

- Right-click and choose “Open with” > your preferred browser

## What I learned

This project increased my confidence in calling apis and then displaying them on a webpage using a list format. It also refreshed my memory in creating and linking multiple pages within a home page.
